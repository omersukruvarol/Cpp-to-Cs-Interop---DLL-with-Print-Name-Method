# Cpp-to-Cs-Interop---DLL-with-Print-Name-Method
This project demonstrates the interoperability between C++ and C# by creating a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) in C++ that includes a method to print a name. The DLL is then accessed and utilized in a C# application to invoke the C++ method. This simple example provides insights into integrating C++ functionality within a C# environment.
